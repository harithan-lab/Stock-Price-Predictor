Stock Price Predictor (LSTM + Streamlit)
This project is a Stock Price Prediction Application built with Python, TensorFlow, and Streamlit. It uses historical stock data from the Alpha Vantage API to train an LSTM model, which predicts the next day's closing price.

üöÄ Features

Fetches real-time stock data (e.g., TSLA, AAPL, MSFT) using the Alpha Vantage API.
Preprocesses data with MinMaxScaler and creates time-series sequences for training.
Trains an LSTM neural network to capture stock price patterns.
Provides a Streamlit web interface for real-time predictions.
Visualizes the last 30 days of stock prices along with the predicted price.
